This is a port to Windows of Flurry, a beautiful screen saver for Mac OS X written by Calum Robinson, ported to Windows by Matt Ginzton and then updated by Julien Templier (aka Littleboy).

What's new in version 1.3.1:

 - Per-monitor flurries: you can now assign a different flurry for each of your monitors
 - Flurry Editor: create new flurry presets and share the templates with your friends!
 - and a few bugs fixed :D
